	* R/EAEngine.R (BNEngine): Removed netDirectory field as this
	properly belongs in PnetWarehouse.

2020-04-01  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/StudentRec.R (newSR): Added warning when replacing a student model.
	(getSR): Added code to generate ID in the NDB case.

2020-03-31  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/StudentRec.R (getSR): Changed this protocol so it returns null
	if the record does not exist.  This way we can test for existance
	if necessary.
	(saveSR): Added function to set the _id in no database version.
	

	* R/EngineGears.R (getRecordForUser): Moved building new record if
	null functionality to here.
	

	* R/StudentRec.R (saveSR): Make sure this always returns the recrod.

2020-03-30  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/EngineGears.R (accumulateEvidence): Changed to use the
	updateRecord function.

	* R/StudentRec.R (updeateRecord): Added this function, as it
	seemed like burrying it in accumulateEvdience was a bad idea.
	
	* R/EAEngine.R (fetchNextEvidence, markEvidence): Added this as a formal
	function, so we could document it more clearly.

2020-03-29  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/EngineGears.R (updateSM): Modified so that it checks both name
	and title.

2020-03-25  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/EngineGears.R (loadManifest): Need to assign to
	eng$warehouseObj, not eng$warehouse() as latter does not have
	assignment method.

	* R/EAEngine.R: (eng$setManifest) Killed call to warehouse() in
	setManifest method, again, circular loading pattern.

	* R/EngineGears.R (loadManifest): Added test for zero row manifest
	to avoid circular loading.

2020-03-21  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/EAEngineNDB.R (BNEngineNDB): Changed listeners to listenerSet.

	* R/EAEngineMongo.R (BNEngineMongo): Changed listeners to
	listenerSet. 

	* R/EAEngine.R: Changed protocol so that ListenerSet is created
	before engine.  This allows more flexibility in configurion
	(with/without database).  

2020-03-15  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/StudentRec.R (StudentRecordSet$recorddb): Make sure that "" is
	intepreted as no database.

2020-03-02  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/StudentRec.R (unparseHist, parseHist): killing these functions
	as they are not being used.
	(unparseStats, stats2json, parseStats): Added flattening features
	which allows for either nested, or unested JSON.
	(strsplit2, unflattenNames): Auxiliary functions used in
	flattening and unflattening stat lists.

2020-03-01  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/StudentRec.R (parseStudentRecord): Addes some as.characters to
	get rid of excessive listiness.

2020-02-19  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/StudentRec.R (parseStudentRecord, as.jlist): History list is
	delicate, need to protect with serialization.

	* R/EngineGears.R (configStats): saveStats is an R6 method of
	eng.  This needs to be moved onto the working branch.
	

2020-02-15  Russell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* R/EngineGears.R: Regular functions and S4 generics and methods
	moved to this file.

	* R/EAEngineNDB.R (BNEngineNDB): No database version of the EA
	engine.

	* R/EAEngineMongo.R (BNMongoEngine): Split off Mongo-dependent
	pieces. 

	* R/EAEngine.R (BNEngine): Split the main engine up into a core
	engine and the peices that use Mongo, and a Mongo-free piece for
	the DataArcade link.

2018-08-14  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* DESCRIPTION (Depends): Renamed package EABN, as this version is
	BN specific.

2018-08-02  Rusell Almond  <ralmond@Cherry>

	* src/mongo.cpp: To compile run
	c++ --std=c++11 <input>.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs
	libmongocxx)
	

	* DESCRIPTION (License): Started Package
